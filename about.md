# About Me

I'm Hrishav Bhattarai — a data scientist with a passion for machine learning, trust-based systems, and digital innovation.  
With a Master's in Computer Science Engineering and multiple IEEE publications, I specialize in building intelligent, secure, and scalable systems.

I've led AI-focused research for smart grids, built QA tools for startups, and developed interactive dashboards for NGOs.  
This portfolio is a snapshot of my journey — blending code, creativity, and curiosity.
