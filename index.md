Hey! I'm Hrishav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious and creative builder with a background in computer engineering and a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I grew up in Nepal, where I first discovered the joy of making things work, whether it was a website or a classroom full of students learning something new.

Over the years, I've worked in diverse environments: from managing rural water data systems in the Himalayas to researching security models for smart meters in the U.S. My journey has taken me across disciplines like software engineering, education, data analytics, and cybersecurity. What ties it all together is my desire to understand systems deeply, make them better, and share what I learn along the way.

I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Toledo, where I worked on trust-based models and Zero Trust Architecture under a $30M AFRL-funded project. I'm also a published IEEE author, and my research bridges fuzzy logic, blockchain, and infrastructure security.

Outside of work, I care deeply about storytelling, accessible design, and community-driven impact. I'm the kind of person who enjoys learning just for the sake of it â€” whether it's exploring a new Python library, reading non-fiction, or deep-diving into a documentary on how cities function.

When I'm not behind a screen, you'll likely find me with a guitar in hand, a book in my backpack, or on the move in nature. I've completed 9 major treks across Nepal, including regions like Annapurna and Dolpa. Those journeys continue to shape how I think about resilience, simplicity, and connection.

Fun fact: As a Snowyak Teaching Fellow, I spent 8 days reaching a remote village in Dolpa â€” two short flights followed by 6 days of non-stop walking to a school with no electricity, radio, TV, or internet. I taught science to students from grades 1â€“6 and helped support a health camp through data collection. It was one of the most grounding experiences of my life.

This website is a small window into my work and journey. Thanks for stopping by, and if something here resonates with you, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
