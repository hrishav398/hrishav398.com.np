# Hey! I'm Hrishav ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m originally from Nepal, and Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work â€” and how to make them better. That curiosity led me to all sorts of projects growing up, whether it was building websites, helping out with school tech stuff, or just figuring things out on my own.

Over time, that interest grew into a mix of work in engineering, teaching, software development, and eventually, data and machine learning. Iâ€™ve worked on rural water systems in the Himalayas, developed cybersecurity models for smart grids, and helped students make sense of circuits and code.

I recently finished my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Toledo, where I focused on Zero Trust Architecture and trust-based security models for Advanced Metering Infrastructure. I also had the chance to publish some of that work in IEEE conferences â€” a milestone Iâ€™m proud of.

Outside of work, I like to read, play guitar, and hike. Iâ€™ve done 9 major treks across Nepal, including Annapurna and Dolpa. As a Snowyak Teaching Fellow, I once spent 8 days reaching a remote school in Dolpa â€” two short flights and six days of walking â€” to teach science to students without access to electricity or internet. Itâ€™s one of the most grounding experiences Iâ€™ve had.

## Currently

I'm actively exploring full-time opportunities in **Data Science** and **AI/ML engineering**, where I can collaborate with curious minds and help build data-driven systems that solve real-world problems.
